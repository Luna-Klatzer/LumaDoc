= LumaDoc ~ A SolarDoc fork  ðŸŒŒâœ¨

LumaDoc is a personal fork which tries to enhance on the foundation provided by Solardoc and implement an improved OT real-time sharing system.

== Development ðŸ› 

=== Setup

To set up the project please install PNPM and Node>=16. Then run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
pnpm install
----

In this project we use a PNPM monorepo structure to manage the various dependencies and packages. As such, PNPM can NOT
be replaced with NPM or Yarn. This is very important to not break the project.

=== Development

To start the various development servers go to the individual packages and run their respective commands in their
directories or use `pnpm run --filter @solardoc/<package> <command>`.

- Frontend: `pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run --filter @solardoc/frontend dev`
- Rest-API: `pnpm run start` or `pnpm run --filter @solardoc/rest-api start`

The Redis DB is Docker-only and as such has to be started using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d redis-db
----

=== Define the ENV vars

The project uses `.env` files to define the environment variables for the various packages. The `.env` files are
located in the root directory of the project and in the individual packages.

Please see for every package their `.env.template` file to see which variables are required. The `.env` files in the
root directory are also used to define the variables for the Docker containers.

=== Deployment

To deploy the project and run a production build, run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

If you already had a build before, use `--build` to force a rebuild:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d --build
----

=== Testing

At the moment, tests are only implemented for `@solardoc/asciidoc-renderer`.

To run the tests, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pnpm run test
----
