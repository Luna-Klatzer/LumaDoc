= SolarDoc 🌌✨

SolarDoc is a dynamic online editor which allows you to create beautiful presentations using AsciiDoc in your browser. Collaborate with your colleagues and friends in the online editor and freely share your work with anyone!

== Problem & Background 🛑

=== Given Situation ⚡

There is no collaborative environment for creating presentations using AsciiDoc. As such, it is difficult to efficiently develop presentations. Currently, there are tools & plugins available to render real-time AsciiDoc and AsciiDoc presentations using revael.js, but they either lack functionality or require monthly license payments. As such they are unsuitable for students and teachers given the college environment.

=== Potential for improvement 💡

- Better code editor for writing AsciiDoc
- Better UI for viewing presentation slides and nested slides
- Ability to easily work collaboratively on presentations
- More accessibility for students and teachers
- Ability to share files with anyone using share links

== Goals 📈

To allow students and teachers to more efficiently create, edit and share presentations. They should be able to easily work together and have a co-working space, where they can manage an entire presentation without the need for external tools. The editor should be performant and responsive, without having to worry too much about rendering time.

== Potential & Risks ⚠️

- Conversion pipeline is too performance-heavy slowing down the browser of the user/client. (AsciiDoc -> Presentation)
- The complexity of creating a presentation might get out of hand with big and detailed presentations.

== Roadmap & Planning 🛣️

The user stories and goals for the project are listed here in the https://github.com/SYP-AHIF-2023-24-25/SolarDoc/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22user+story%22[discussions page].

== Development 🛠

=== Setup

To set up the project please install PNPM and Node>=16. Then run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
pnpm install
----

In this project we use a PNPM monorepo structure to manage the various dependencies and packages. As such, PNPM can NOT
be replaced with NPM or Yarn. This is very important to not break the project.

=== Development

To start the various development servers go to the individual packages and run their respective commands in their
directories or use `pnpm run --filter @solardoc/<package> <command>`.

- Frontend: `pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run --filter @solardoc/frontend dev`
- Rest-API: `pnpm run start` or `pnpm run --filter @solardoc/rest-api start`

The Redis DB is Docker-only and as such has to be started using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d redis-db
----

=== Define the ENV vars

The project uses `.env` files to define the environment variables for the various packages. The `.env` files are
located in the root directory of the project and in the individual packages.

Please see for every package their `.env.template` file to see which variables are required. The `.env` files in the
root directory are also used to define the variables for the Docker containers.

=== Deployment

To deploy the project and run a production build, run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

If you already had a build before, use `--build` to force a rebuild:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d --build
----

=== Testing

At the moment, tests are only implemented for `@solardoc/asciidoc-renderer`. This is expected to change by v0.3.0, but
at the moment only the renderer is tested.

To run the tests, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pnpm run test
----
