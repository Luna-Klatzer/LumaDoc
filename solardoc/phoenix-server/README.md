# SolardocPhoenix

This is the WebSocket server using Elixir Phoenix for the SolarDoc project.

It ships with a minor frontend, although the main functionality of the server will be to provide a websocket server
where users should be able to join pools that receive editor updates and notify joint users.

## Dev

To start the Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
